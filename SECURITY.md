# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The heatmap-tracker plugin is actively maintained, and I support the **latest version** only. Older versions may work but will not receive security updates or bug fixes.

| Version      | Supported          |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| Latest (1.10.x or newer) | :white_check_mark: |
| Older versions          | :x:                |

> **Note:** While older versions are expected to function, I recommend always using the latest version to ensure you benefit from the latest features, improvements, and security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. Submit an issue or contact me directly via [contact method/email/issue tracker].
2. Expect an acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours.
3. Updates will be provided as the issue is investigated, typically within one week.
4. If the vulnerability is accepted, a fix will be implemented in the latest version, and you will be notified of the resolution. If declined, reasons will be provided.

Thank you for helping improve the heatmap-tracker plugin!
