`insights` - is a powerful instrument for calculating and displaying your own insights in `Statistics`.

### Example
You're tracking steps per day and you want to know how many days per this year you achieved your goal - 10000 steps per day.

Let's look at the code below:
- `name` - the name of the metric you want to see (it will be displayed in `Statistics`)
- `calculate` - function that has `yearEntries` as input (in the future more data will be added), and should have `string` or `number` as output.

In our example it has `10000` as a goal and we filter `entries` take only those, where `value` is more then our target (10000).

```
{
  name: "Days Achieved Step Goal (10,000 steps)",
  calculate: ({ yearEntries }) => {
    const stepGoal = 10000;
    const daysAchieved = yearEntries.filter((entry) => entry.value >= stepGoal).length;
    return daysAchieved.toString();
  },
}
```

That's how it will look:

```dataviewjs

const trackerData = {
    year: 2024, // optional, remove this line to autoswitch year
    entries: [],
    heatmapTitle: "ğŸ‘£ Steps Tracker ğŸ‘£",
    insights: [{
        name: "Days Achieved Step Goal (10,000 steps)",
        calculate: ({ yearEntries }) => {
            const stepGoal = 10000;
            const daysAchieved = yearEntries.filter((entry) => entry.value >= stepGoal).length;
            return daysAchieved.toString();
        },
    }]
}

 
for(let page of dv.pages('"daily notes"').where(p=>p.steps)){

    trackerData.entries.push({
        date: page.file.name,
        intensity: page.steps,
        content: await dv.span(`[](${page.file.name})`),
    })  
}

renderHeatmapTrackerStatistics(this.container, trackerData)
renderHeatmapTracker(this.container, trackerData)

```
