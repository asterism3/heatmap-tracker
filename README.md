## Start with this code example
> **Tip:** Replace `trackerData` with your own dataset to visualize custom data points.

> **Tip:** Add `dataviewjs` in the beginning of your code block to enable DataviewJS functionality.

```javascript
// Update this object
const trackerData = {
    entries: [],
    separateMonths: true,
    heatmapTitle: "This is the title for your heatmap",
    heatmapSubtitle: "This is the subtitle for your heatmap. You can use it as a description.",
    /**
      * intensityScaleStart: The minimum intensity value for the heatmap scale.
      * If you count steps, this could be 0, representing the lowest count (e.g., not achieving step goals).
      */
    // intensityScaleStart: 0,

    /**
      * intensityScaleEnd: The maximum intensity value for the heatmap scale.
      * If you count steps and have a goal of 10,000 steps per day, this could be 10000.
      */
    // intensityScaleEnd: 1,
}

// Path to the folder with notes
const PATH_TO_YOUR_FOLDER = "daily notes preview/notes";
// Name of the parameter you want to see on this heatmap
const PARAMETER_NAME = 'steps';

// You need dataviewjs plugin to get information from your pages
for(let page of dv.pages(`"${PATH_TO_YOUR_FOLDER}"`).where((p) => p[PARAMETER_NAME])){
    trackerData.entries.push({
        date: page.file.name,
        intensity: page[PARAMETER_NAME],
        content: await dv.span(`[](${page.file.name})`)
    });
}

renderHeatmapTracker(this.container, trackerData);
```


The **Heatmap Tracker** plugin is a versatile and visually appealing tool for tracking data over a calendar year. This plugin empowers you to create beautiful heatmaps for various purposes, such as habit tracking, project progress, or data visualization directly within Obsidian. Below is a comprehensive overview of its features, usage, and development opportunities.

This plugin is useful for tracking progress for exercise, finances, social time, project progression, passions, learning progress and so on.   

To be used with [Obsidian Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/), but could be used standalone or with other plugins as well (if you know some javascript).

## ðŸ“– How to use

1. Annotate the data you want to track in your daily notes (see [Dataview annotation documentation](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/data-annotation/)) 

2. Create a [DataviewJS block](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/api/intro/) where you want the Heatmap Tracker to display.  

3. Collect the data you want to display using [DataviewJS](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/api/code-reference/)

4. Pass the data into Heatmap Tracker using  **renderHeatmapTracker()**

## Development (Windows/Mac):

 ```npm run dev``` - will start an automatic TS to JS transpiler and automatically copy the generated JS/CSS/manifest files to the example vault when modified (Remember to run ```npm install``` first).

 After the files have been transpiled, the **hot-reload plugin** (https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload) then reloads Obsidian automatically.
 Hot-reload is installed in the example vault by default. its used to avoid restarting obsidian after every change to code.  
 *(remember to add an empty *.hotreload* file to "EXAMPLE_VAULT/.obsidian/plugins/heatmap-tracker/" if not already present, as this tells hot-reload to watch for changes)*


```npm run build``` generates the files ready for distribution.

&nbsp;

Tip: ```ctrl-shift-i``` opens the devtools inside Obsidian.

## Technical Explanation
All the plugin does, is add the function ***renderHeatmapTracker()*** to the global namespace of you vault.

**"this.container"** is passed as the first argument because the plugin needs to know where to render the tracker. You don't have to worry about this.

"renderHeatmapTracker()" then takes **"trackerData"** as the secondary argument. This is the javascript object you have to create yourself in order to give plugin instructions and data. Most of the properties are optional, but you have to supply an entries array as an absolute minimum.  

See the beginning of the readme for the full code example.
