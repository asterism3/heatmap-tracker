### ðŸŒŸ Example Usage

Below is an example JavaScript snippet to use the Heatmap Tracker:

~~~javascript
/```dataviewjs

// Update this object
const trackerData = {
    year: 2024,
    entries: [],
    separateMonths: true
}

// in dv.pages set your folder name
// in where add frontmatter property
for(let page of dv.pages('"daily notes"').where(p=>p.exercise)){
    trackerData.entries.push({
        date: page.file.name,
        intensity: page.exercise,
        content: await dv.span(`[](${page.file.name})`)
    });
}

dv.paragraph("** NAME OF THE HEATMAP **");

renderHeatmapTracker(this.container, trackerData);
```
~~~
> **Tip:** Replace `trackerData` with your own dataset to visualize custom data points.

## Development (Windows/Mac):

 ```npm run dev``` - will start an automatic TS to JS transpiler and automatically copy the generated JS/CSS/manifest files to the example vault when modified (Remember to run ```npm install``` first).

 After the files have been transpiled, the **hot-reload plugin** (https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload) then reloads Obsidian automatically.
 Hot-reload is installed in the example vault by default. its used to avoid restarting obsidian after every change to code.  
 *(remember to add an empty *.hotreload* file to "EXAMPLE_VAULT/.obsidian/plugins/heatmap-tracker/" if not already present, as this tells hot-reload to watch for changes)*


```npm run build``` generates the files ready for distribution.

&nbsp;

Tip: ```ctrl-shift-i``` opens the devtools inside Obsidian.

## Technical Explanation
All the plugin does, is add the function ***renderHeatmapTracker()*** to the global namespace of you vault.

**"this.container"** is passed as the first argument because the plugin needs to know where to render the tracker. You don't have to worry about this.

"renderHeatmapTracker()" then takes **"trackerData"** as the secondary argument. This is the javascript object you have to create yourself in order to give plugin instructions and data. Most of the properties are optional, but you have to supply an entries array as an absolute minimum.  

See the beginning of the readme for the full code example.

### Absolute minimum code example:
~~~javascript
\```dataviewjs

const trackerData = {
    entries: [],                
}

renderHeatmapTracker(this.container, trackerData)

```
